AMR  are robots capable of navigating and performing 
    tasks in dynamic environments without constant human intervention or guidance. These robots utilize various sensors, 
    algorithms, and decision-making capabilities to autonomously move, interact with their surroundings, and execute predefined 
    tasks or missions. AMRs find applications across various industries, including logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, retail, 
    agriculture, and more. They offer benefits such as increased efficiency, improved safety, cost savings through automation, 
    and the ability to handle tasks in dynamic and unstructured environments.
