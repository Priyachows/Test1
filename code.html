    <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; font-family: arial;">AMR  are robots capable of navigating and performing 
        tasks in dynamic environments without constant human intervention or guidance. These robots utilize various sensors, 
        algorithms, and decision-making capabilities to autonomously move, interact with their surroundings, and execute predefined 
        tasks or missions. AMRs find applications across various industries, including logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, retail, 
        agriculture, and more. They offer benefits such as increased efficiency, improved safety, cost savings through automation, 
        and the ability to handle tasks in dynamic and unstructured environments.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; font-family: arial;"><strong>can it do?</strong> </p>
        <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; font-family: arial;">The AMR generates vast quantities of data from their sensors and interactions, necessitating efficient data collection, storage, management, and analysis to support their perception, localization, planning, and other essential functions.</p>
